## Day 1 – Project Setup & Understanding Data
- Created the repository structure and added an initial notebook/script for experimentation.
- Reviewed the credit card fraud detection problem: highly imbalanced binary classification where fraud cases are rare compared to normal transactions.
​- Noted key goals: handle class imbalance properly, build baseline models, and focus on precision/recall and AUC instead of accuracy.
