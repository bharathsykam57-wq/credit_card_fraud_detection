## Credit Card Fraud Detection
In the digital age, cybersecurity plays a crucial role in protecting financial transactions and personal data. One of the major challenges in this space is accurately detecting unusual or suspicious activities within vast streams of credit card transactions.
​

This project focuses on building a system capable of learning normal transaction patterns and identifying anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior. When the system detects a transaction that significantly deviates from learned patterns, it should flag or block the transaction to prevent potential fraud.
​

Modern machine learning techniques provide powerful tools for classifying irregular transactions based on historical data. With sufficient past transaction records and a well-chosen algorithm, the model can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities, improving security while minimizing disruption to genuine users.
